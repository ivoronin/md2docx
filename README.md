# Introduction

A simple program that converts a markdown file into a docx file.

# Usage

    python md2docx.py sample.md sample.docx


The docx file will be overwritten if it already exists.

# TODO

The inline styles are yet to be converted so if you use bold, italics
etc., you'll get HTML tags in your doc file.
